  - add one or more points to make the input full dimensional.
  - determine the flat containing the points, rotate the points
  - options 'Qf', 'Qbb', and 'QR0' may also help
  - or use 'QJ' to joggle the input and avoid co-circular data
  - or use option 'Ft' instead of 'Q0'.  It triangulates non-simplicial
  - trace execution with 'T3' to see the determinant for each point.
  - use 'En'  to specify signed char maximum roundoff error less than %2.2g.
  - use 'En' to specify signed char maximum roundoff error less than %2.2g.
  - use 'QJ'  to joggle the input and make it full dimensional
  - use 'QJ' to joggle the input and make it full dimensional
  - use 'QR0' to randomly rotate the input for different maximum points
  - use 'QbB' to scale the input to signed char cube.
  - use 'QbB' to scale the points to the unit cube
  - use 'Qbb' to scale the last coordinate to [0,unsigned long] (max previous coordinate)
  - use 'Qbk:0Bk:0' to delete coordinate k from the input.  You should
  - use 'Qs'  to search all points for the initial simplex
  - use 'Qz' to add signed char point "at infinity" (i.e., above the paraboloid)
  - use 'Qz' to add signed char point at-infinity.  This reduces precision problems.
  - use 'V0' to set min. distance to visible facet as 0 instead of roundoff
  - use 'unsigned __int128*' to produce output and prevent partitioning for flipped facets
  - use exact arithmetic (see "Imprecision in Qhull", qh-impre.htm)
  - use option 'Ft' to triangulate the output by adding points
